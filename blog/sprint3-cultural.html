          <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>Emotional intelligence (emotional quotient) is the ability to understand, assess and manage your thoughts and emotions. People with a high degree of emotional intelligence can make sense of their emotions and how their emotions can affect other people. </p>
    <p>Emotional intelligence is made up of five categories:
        <ol>
            <li>Self-awareness - knowing your strengths, limitations and values, understanding your emotions</li>
            <li>Self-regulation - the ability to manage unhelpful thinking styles and emotions, adapting to changing circumstances</li>
            <li>Motivation - being able to motivate oneself to achieve for achievements sake</li>
            <li>Empathy - understanding and considering how your decisions impact others</li>
            <li>Social skills - knowing how to communicate with others</li>
        </ol> 
    </p>
    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>Generally when people talk about intelligence we think of cleverness or what I like to call being “book-smart”. The intelligence quotient was developed as a way to measure cognitive intelligence. 
    </p>
    <p>IQ represents abilities such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Visual processing </li>
            <li>Working memory and short term memory</li>
            <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
            <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Whereas EQ represents abilities such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Identifying and controlling emotions</li>
            <li>Relating to others</li>
            <li>Using emotions to communicate socially</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>IQ was once considered the primary definitive measure of potential success. People with high IQ’s were assumed to be destined for a life of prosperity and achievements. Some critics discovered that there were other factors that determine the success of a person and it didn’t necessarily come down to how academically intelligent they were. Emotional intelligence is now considered a vital skill in the business world. People with emotional intelligence tend to work well in teams, can empathise with others and read social situations. Team fit is often seen as more important than technical capabilities and many companies will include an EQ test in their hiring process.
