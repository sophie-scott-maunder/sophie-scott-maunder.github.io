    <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
    <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>I would love to eventually work in an industry where I can combine some of my other interests such as fashion, music, journalism, sustainable practices etc </p>
    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
    <p>I would really like to develop the way I learn and retain information. I find I have quite a short attention span and can get distracted easily. If information isn’t delivered in a visual way I struggle to remember what I’ve been taught. I want to be an active listener.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations:</h3>
    <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>
        I have a fear of failure - when I start something I commit to it a hundred percent and dislike having unfinished projects. I am a creative thinker and am good at visualising a project or an end goal. I am reliable - I hate letting people down. I can see the bigger picture and am able to adapt to suit the needs of a team. I am decisive - I know what I like and don’t like. I am really passionate about the things I care about.
        </p>
    <p><strong>Limitations: </strong>
        When I feel stressed or overwhelmed I can catastrophise obstacles, shut down and struggle to see a way forward. This is when my emotions take over and I am incapable of thinking logically. I can be intolerable of people who act or think differently from myself. I prefer working with people who think similarly or have common interests. I can be impatient with myself and others - I like to see the results of progress and get frustrated with too much talking and not enough action.
        </p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h3>
    <p>I will aim to contact my facilitator and seek help when I have been working on a problem for half a day/four hours. Hopefully with time I will feel confident to reach out to my cohort/slack channel when I need assistance.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h3>
    <p>I would like to meet up with my facilitator on a weekly basis at the very minimum. Casual catch ups are great and I can be flexible with when these are. In the beginning I would prefer to be catching up more often, with the idea that this could be reduced when I become more confident with the content I’m learning.
