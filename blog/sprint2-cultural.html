        <h2>Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h1>
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </h2>
        <p>I would really love to be able to combine some of my existing passions and skills to create beautiful and
            meaningful projects for myself, like-minded people and local businesses. I have spent most of my working
            life in Government entities so I can’t see myself working as a developer for a large corporation. I’m more
            interested in working for small startup companies who share the same ethos and values as me. I would also
            love to help my sister create a website and/or online store for her chocolatier business.
        </p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p><strong>Strengths:</strong>
            I think I will bring vibrancy and creative flair to Bootcamp. I already have ideas up my sleeve and visions
            of the kinds of projects I would love to make and work on so I am really looking forward to pitch day! Over
            the course of foundations I realised that I am good at time keeping. I detest spending extended periods of
            time a problem so I would always ask for assistance if I thought I was spending too much time on something.
            I am reliable and will do what I say I’m going to do.

            <strong>Limitations:</strong>
            Over the course of the last five weeks I have realised that learning JavaScript has not come easily for me.
            I know that I’m going to have to push myself in this area. During foundations I found myself comparing my
            abilities to those of my cohort. This created a lot of self doubt and negativity on my part, particularly
            when I was struggling on a challenge that other people found easy.
        </p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <p>I have a tendency to put on cruise control if I am getting through the bare minimum of work. I struggle to
            push myself to succeed even though I know I am more than capable. I don’t want to get to the end of Bootcamp
            and regret not giving it my all.
            <br>
            I generally like working in teams and am good at it. But if I’m working on a project I’m not passionate
            about or if I’m paired with someone who I might clash with, I will struggle find enthusiasm and give it my
            all.</p>
        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
        <p>I would like to build more resilience. I have noticed over the years that I have become increasingly anxious
            and stressed when I’m overwhelmed and faced with difficult situations. When I’m in this fight or flight mode
            I struggle to get to sleep at night. And when I’m not getting enough sleep everything else goes with it.
            Ideally I would like to notice when I start feeling like this before it gets to that stage and becomes a
            problem for myself and the other people I have to work with. </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>I would like to meet up with a Bootcamp leader on a weekly basis. Casual catch ups are great and I can be
            flexible with when these are. In the beginning I would prefer to catch up more often, with the idea that
            this could be reduced when I become more confident with the content I’m learning. I don’t expect to be
            pushed but a gentle cajole in the right direction wouldn’t go a miss! I thrive off positive affirmation
            (when deserved) so I’m less likely to doubt my abilities and try harder if I know I’m making progress.</p>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>I will aim to be on site for a minimum of 10 hours per weekday (starting at 8am and finishing at 6pm) and
            splitting the remaining needed hours between Saturday and Sunday. I get my best work done in the morning so
            getting enough sleep the night before will be crucial to my success on the course. If I’m experiencing any
            issues with the content, workload, other learners etc, my first port of call would be to talk to my
            facilitator.</p>

        <h2>Learning Plan - Foundations</h2>
        <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>I would love to eventually work in an industry where I can combine some of my other interests such as
            fashion, music, journalism, sustainable practices etc </p>
        <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
        <p>I would really like to develop the way I learn and retain information. I find I have quite a short attention
            span and can get distracted easily. If information isn’t delivered in a visual way I struggle to remember
            what I’ve been taught. I want to be an active listener.
        </p>
        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations:</h3>
        <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>
            I have a fear of failure - when I start something I commit to it a hundred percent and dislike having
            unfinished projects. I am a creative thinker and am good at visualising a project or an end goal. I am
            reliable - I hate letting people down. I can see the bigger picture and am able to adapt to suit the needs
            of a team. I am decisive - I know what I like and don’t like. I am really passionate about the things I care
            about.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Limitations: </strong>
            When I feel stressed or overwhelmed I can catastrophise obstacles, shut down and struggle to see a way
            forward. This is when my emotions take over and I am incapable of thinking logically. I can be intolerable
            of people who act or think differently from myself. I prefer working with people who think similarly or have
            common interests. I can be impatient with myself and others - I like to see the results of progress and get
            frustrated with too much talking and not enough action.
        </p>
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h3>
        <p>I will aim to contact my facilitator and seek help when I have been working on a problem for half a day/four
            hours. Hopefully with time I will feel confident to reach out to my cohort/slack channel when I need
            assistance.
        </p>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h3>
        <p>I would like to meet up with my facilitator on a weekly basis at the very minimum. Casual catch ups are great
            and I can be flexible with when these are. In the beginning I would prefer to be catching up more often,
            with the idea that this could be reduced when I become more confident with the content I’m learning.
