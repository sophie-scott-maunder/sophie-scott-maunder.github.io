    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <h3>The difference between HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>Building a website using HTML and CSS is like making a birthday cake. The HTML is the core structure of the cake. The sponge tiers are layered on top of one another but with no decorations or icing to add style and flavour. Some people might really like basic cakes but a birthday cake looks and tastes better with cream between the layers, piped icing and decorations. This is our cakes CSS - it adds style to what would otherwise be a very boring sponge cake.</p>
    <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
    <p>Control flow is the order that instructions, statements or functions are executed in. In javascript, we read the code starting from the first line till the last line unless there are instructions or statements that change the control flow.
    </p>
    <p>Loops are a set of simple instructions which tell a computer to perform an action over and over again until the set of criteria is met. This could be likened to reading a book - each page (the action) is read in order until the book is finished (the loop).            
    </p>
    <h3>The DOM</h3>
    <p>The DOM stands for Document Object Model and is the structural representation of your web page. The document is organised in a tree like structure called the DOM tree. Each node/branch of the tree represents an element. For example, the document as a whole, the head, the body, the title, the text etc.</p>

    <p>We can use JavaScript to read, write and manipulate elements on our DOM tree. We can access the HTML elements through JavaScript without needing to go into our HTML document. JavaScript can alter, add and remove both HTML attributes and CSS elements. A good example of this is writing and calling (actioning) functions that change the colour of a particular CSS element.</p>

    <h3>Functions</h3>

    <p>Functions are one of the most important mechanisms of JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure that performs a task or calculates a value and can be used over and over again. The first thing you must do is define the function, meaning that you must write the instructions for the function to perform. Then you must define what arguments (rules) the function needs to know in order to do its job.</p>

    <h3>Arrays and objects</h3>
    <p>Arrays are variables that create an ordered list of information. When you retrieve information from the array, you use the index of each element. An array index starts counting at 0 rather than 1. They are presented and written as a list of values between square brackets which are separated by commas.
    </p>
    <p>var groceryList = [“apples”, “pears”, “lemons”, “onions”];</p>
    <p>Objects are variables that organise information based on data labels. We can store multiple values provided that they are assigned a property. Objects are often used to store information about a single entity such as a sign-up form. We store the information between curly brackets with dot notations.

    <p>var signUp = {name: “Sophie”, age: 27, email: “sophie-scott-maunder@gmail.com”};</p></div>
