        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
        <p>I faced a problem during my second Kata exercise. It was a super simple problem that I was stuck on for
            hours. I had written the code correctly but for some reason it wasn’t passing the tests. I tried all kinds
            of syntax to make the tests pass but nothing worked. I asked my facilitator what was going on and we tried
            working it through together until the browser we were using crashed! I was stuck on this problem for another
            evening before I asked another person in my cohort to look over my code. We realised that my code was fine
            but it was the order I had stacked my variables and functions that was affecting the way it was being
            called. I felt really anxious asking someone to look over my work and that they would judge my inability to
            write JavaScript! I learnt that this wasn’t the case and that it’s better to ask for help than to be
            struggling on something in silence.
        </p>
        <p>
            I surprised myself on the third Kata challenge. I managed to get through most of the tests without needing
            to ask for help which definitely boosted my confidence. I wrote some pseudocode in comments inside a
            function when I got stuck trying to find a solution that would return the average score. I understood the
            logic of what I had to make the function do but I didn’t know the syntax to make the tests pass. I turned to
            Dr Google and searched <em>“for loop average number javascript”</em> and low and behold I found the perfect solution
            to help pass the test. I asked my facilitator, retrospectively, to explain each element of the function so
            that I could fully comprehend what the for loop was doing. I felt less embarrassed about asking for help
            this time because I had already tried out multiple avenues to solve the problem myself.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
        <p><strong>Pseudocode</strong> - This is a technique that I’m inexperienced at but keen to develop. I can see
            it being a really helpful way to begin solving a problem.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Trying something</strong> - Very happy to try something but can’t say it’s worked all that well for
            me!
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - This is something I have used in the past with work related queries
            but never with coding. I’m sure that I will use this technique when I become more competent at coding.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Reading error messages</strong> - I do not feel confident reading error messages and it’s probably
            because red text repels me! I’m avoidant of error messages but hopefully I will understand their importance
            and learn to love them haha.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Console.logging</strong> - I kind of understand the process of logging to the console but would like
            to become more confident in using it to solve problems and seeing where things are getting stuck.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Googling</strong> - I would say I’m too confident doing this and is probably the first thing I do
            when I encounter a problem! I would like to get better at trying out different problem solving techniques
            before reverting to my favourite search engine.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Asking peers for help</strong> - I’m reluctant to ask for help from people in my cohort and it’s
            probably because there is a whole lot of pride wrapped up in asking peers for guidance. I think I’ll become
            more comfortable asking for help once I get to know everyone a bit better.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - I’m okay asking coaches for help but am concerned about how
            frequently I am asking for help and coming across super needy. I want to try and implement some of the other
            problem solving techniques before I ask for assistance.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Improving process with reflection</strong> - I feel confident reflecting on my learning. I don’t know
            if reflecting will help me solve problems in the future because most of my reflections are emotion based.
