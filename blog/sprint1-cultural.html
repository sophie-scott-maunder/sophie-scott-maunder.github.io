        <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>
    <p>I like to think that my core values are interwoven and align with one another. Creativity has been a huge part of my life and this was nurtured from a young age. My interests have always rested within the realms of creativity whether that was writing, dancing, performing, creating art, making music or taking photos. </p>
    <p>Diversity, equity and fairness are all values that have shaped my personal identity. I strongly believe that diversity creates innovation and that having diverse representation is essential to progress. Over the years I have been involved in creative pursuits and projects that treat diversity as the norm and not the exception. As a result I have found it particularly difficult to work in environments where there is a clear lack of diversity and inclusivity. On a few occasions when I have heard friends, family or colleagues talk negatively about marginalised communities, I feel a real obligation to say something (whether it affects me or not). Most of the time this is met with frostiness but hopefully it has given them an opportunity to reflect on what they’ve said and why I think it is inappropriate.
    </p>
    <p>I grew up in a matriarchal household with three mothers AKA a mum and two older sisters. A lot of their values regarding feminism, gender stereotypes and independence have inherently been passed down to me. These values are ingrained in my culture and are part of my personal identity. Feminism is equity for all and is a non-negotiable value of mine. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Strengths: </strong>
        I have a fear of failure - when I start something I commit to it a hundred percent and dislike having unfinished projects. I am a creative thinker and am good at visualising a project or an end goal. I am reliable - I hate letting people down. I can see the bigger picture and am able to adapt to suit the needs of a team. I am decisive - I know what I like and don’t like. I am really passionate about the things I care about.
        </p>
    <p><strong>Limitations: </strong>
        When I feel stressed or overwhelmed I can catastrophise obstacles, shut down and struggle to see a way forward. This is when my emotions take over and I am incapable of thinking logically. I can be intolerable of people who act or think differently from myself. I prefer working with people who think similarly or have common interests. I can be impatient with myself and others - I like to see the results of progress and get frustrated with too much talking and not enough action.
        </p>
    <p>I think that my proudness will overrule any obstacle I cross. Even if I feel like I can’t see a way forward, my persistence will force me to complete the task on hand (even if it is through gritted teeth). I am motivated by the fear of failure which sometimes can be a blessing and a curse!
    </p>
    <p>I worked with a person whose communication style was the polar opposite of mine. Even though I come across as a confident person, I struggle with anxiety and will overthink every little interaction with another person. This colleague would communicate in ways which I found really passive aggressive and most interactions were tense. I started to get really anxious about going into work and felt trapped because of the work hierarchy. Things definitely improved when a new person joined our team but it was an ongoing struggle that was never fully resolved. Looking back now I think I should have communicated with my manager what was going on for me. I was never really sure if it was all in my head or not so I feel like articulating my feelings in a rational way would have improved the situation.
