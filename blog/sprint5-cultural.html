        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
            One of the things I have learnt during the core learning experience was that I’m not very good at describing
            my strengths without construing them negatively. For instance, my fear of failing is the biggest incentive
            for me to complete a project. It would be far nicer for me to say my drive to succeed is the biggest impetus
            for me to achieve my goals! I think that I probably come across as quite a confident person but I definitely
            struggle with self doubt when it comes to my ability to learn new skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have realised that I feel uncomfortable sharing my writing with my cohort, and in particular my identity,
            values and strengths based core learning. Exposing myself (and my ego) in such a public way was far more
            difficult than I anticipated. I found myself censoring and watering-down my writing, putting too much
            thought into how other people would perceive me if they were reading it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learnt that the harder the technical challenges got, the more I craved to do the core learning! It felt
            almost like a chore to begin with until I started feeling out of depth when I started learning JavaScript. I
            realised that writing in English (not code) is something that comes very naturally and easily to me, even if
            it is deeply personal. I have become more confident sharing my personal experiences over the five weeks of
            foundations.
        </p>

        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming? </h2>
        <p>
            I think the role of values, empathy and self awareness are not just limited to programming but any role
            where you have to interact with other people. Teamwork is such a huge part of learning and becoming a
            developer. If you are unable to get along with others and exercise self-awareness, empathy and appropriate
            social skills it is going to be very difficult to be part of a team. In most cases, working in a team is
            more common than not, so being able to share your values, show empathy and consider others will be a highly
            valuable skill.

        </p>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h2>
        <p>
            For someone who enjoys writing so much, I was surprised at how difficult it was to write about myself
            knowing that it was going to be read by an audience. As I mentioned above, I ended up writing the core
            values, strengths and limitations blog with other people in mind instead of being true to myself. I thought
            that I would have found this easier than the technical work, which was surprising.
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Describing my values was a particularly challenging task. I got really stuck on defining what they were and
            why they were important to me. I obviously have values but I kept getting stuck on the fact of being “good”
            at them or “living my life” by them. The more I read blog posts from the other people in my cohort, the more
            difficult it became for me to write my own. I sought some alternative views from my friends and family when
            I felt like I couldn’t narrow down my values. They helped me to realise that you don’t have to be a slave to
            your values for them not to be important to you.
        </p>
        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
            development bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>I’m sure we’ve all been in a position where we have had to work in a team with someone who, for whatever
            reason, is difficult to work with. Maybe they struggle to relate to others, maybe they take constructive
            criticism as a personal attack, maybe they’re not motivated to get the job done. Core learning is an
            essential part of teamwork, and teamwork is a huge part of working in web development. Learning these skills
            will hopefully eliminate or at least reduce conflict in a team. Understanding ourselves so we can help
            understand others better.
        </p>
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
            that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>I think it is super important to reflect on what core skills/soft skills a developer needs to be successful.
            I feel like studying core learning is setting me up for being able to work in a team as well as assisting me
            with information to use when applying for jobs. However, I did find that there was quite a bit of crossover
            between the core questions throughout the sprints as well as in our personal reflections. I think I would
            have been able to express myself in a more honest way had the core learning been kept between my facilitator
            and I.
