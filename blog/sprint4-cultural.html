        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
            Accepting the principles of neuroplasticity is perhaps the first stage of learning to think in a growth
            mindset. The principles of neuroplasticity benefit not only those with learning difficulties or those who
            have suffered from neurological events, but also people who are wanting to learn new skills or improve
            existing ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            The principles of neuroplasticity wouldn’t necessarily be new concepts to most people. By engaging and
            utilising the simple principles of neuroplasticity we can enhance our ability to learn new things. Using,
            improving, repeating, challenging and training the brain are all important ways to change our own
            neuroplasticity. I’m interested in how engaging with meaningful and salient learning will change and
            strengthen the way I retain information.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many physical, emotional, intellectual and behavioural ways to increase ones neuroplasticity. It
            could be as simple as walking home a different way from work than you normally would or it could be
            practicing mindfulness and meditation in order to awaken your consciousness. Awareness of improving
            neuroplasticity allows the brain to behave in a growth mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found <a href="http://secondwindmovement.com/neuroplasticity/">this research</a> on neuroplasticity
            particularly interesting.
        </p>
        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
            A growth mindset is a belief that skills and intelligence are grown and developed through determination and
            hardwork. It creates the foundation for great learning and shows that it can improve our ability to grow and
            develop neuroplasticity. Our brains are still capable of learning new things which means that utilising a
            growth mindset is just as relevant to all areas of our life as it was when we were children.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since childhood, I’ve generally always operated with a growth mindset (subconsciously or not) and began
            learning about it this year when I was helping my friend through her teachers college study. I had been
            under the impression that a growth mindset tends to only be relevant to school children and teenagers so
            it’s interesting to learn that a lot of corporate companies and organisations are implementing the growth
            mindset into their business strategies as a way to promote company profit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning a new skill comes with a whole new set of challenges. Finding ways of strategising and overcoming
            these challenges is going to be key to achieving successes throughout my learning journey. Things to
            personally focus on will be language which promotes a growth mindset. Instead of focusing on the end
            destination I’m going to focus on the journey of learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75GFzikmRY0">this video</a> on growth mindset really
            engaging.
        </p>
        <h2>Learning Plan and Strategies</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Perfectionism - whatever you do is good enough for now, come back and work on it later</li>
                <li>Complete the easiest things first - seeing progress creates more progress</li>
                <li>Break down hard things into smaller steps</li>
                <li>Temptations add fuel to the fire - celebrate milestones</li>
                <li>Find the flow - find when the creative flow is “just right” and keep working through it </li>
            </ul>
